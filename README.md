# Trailer Mode UX Prototype

A prototype for a better UX while exploring content on video streaming services like Netflix and Apple TV.

_[ todo: screenshot ]_

Instead of scrolling through horizontal sliders of thumbnails, and going through lots of clicks to open a , or auto-playing on mouseover (which has lots of false positives and annonyances)

user clicks a category of content, and then start playing a list of trailers
but make it quick and easy to skip to next if don't like it
and only have to click 1 button to add the show to your watch queue

able to judge based on the actual content of video rather than the thumbnail

psychology concept of suficificers vs maximizers.
this is better for both, but MUCH better for maximizers
