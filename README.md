# Trailer Mode UX Prototype

A prototype for a better UX while exploring content on video streaming services like Netflix and Apple TV.

Often the UI for discovering content involves scrolling through horizontal sliders of thumbnails, and then mousing over an thumbnail for auto-play a tiny video, or having to click to open a new page and clicking to play the video there, and then going back to start over.

That's a bad UX because you have to judge initial interest based on thumbnails, and then deal with unnecessary clicks and annoying behaviors to view the trailer.

This experiements with a different approach, where you view trailers one after another, and can press a single button to jump to the next, or to add it to a "watch later" list. That streamlines the flow, and gives a much better sense of whether the video is worth queueing.
