a prototype UX for netflix/apple tv/etc -

screenshot

instead of scrolling through horizontal sliders of thumbnails,
have user click a category of content, and then start playing a list of trailers, 
and only have to click 1 button to add the show to your watch queue,
or to move to the next trailer. can hardcode list of trailers on youtube as sample content.

mentino the psychological concept of suficificers vs maximizers.
this is better for both, but MUCH better for maximizers
